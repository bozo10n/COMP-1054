   TASK FIVE - Reflection â€” answer this in your submission (comment or README)
   ============================

1) In what real UI situations on the web or in apps would using a GRID with SUBGRID give you a clear advantage over flexbox or manual equal-height tricks?

 1. Some apps that I can think of are product cards on ecommerce sites and blog posts (weirdly specific because I have used it in my own person portfolio + blog site)

 2. Feature comparison tables where feature lists have 
   different heights but buttons need to align at the bottom.

 3. Form layouts. Multi-column forms where labels and inputs need to align 
   vertically across columns, even when some fields have validation messages.
